						<p class="description">It all started with me realizing that my studies were not a great fit for me. I began learning 3D on my own as a hobby as well as a potential
							way of making a living. Below are a few exmples of my very first commercial work for event visual effects / promotion videos.

						<p class="description">Since video games have always been a part of my life, I began to see an opportunity to use my skills to make them, so I have dedicated myself to
							learning code. After some time of learning C# and Unity, I was offered a programmer position at Strange Fire. At that time, the team was developing a Shoppe Keep sequel.
							Me, still being very new to the industry, began making my own title under lead programmer's mentornship. Below is a snippet from my first Unity project without a tutorial.

						<p class="description">When it was time to move on to a visual polish stage, I had an opportunity to improve my 3D modelling knowledge and include basics of animation to my skillset.

						<p class="description">Not very long after, I was granted an opportunity to develop my own title on a Nintendo Switch platform, which lead me to become sort of a game designer.
							The game was meant to be played either alone or compete against a friend via a splitscreen. It offered several different game-modes where players competed either among each
							other or against a high score. Below are a couple of snippets of a very early development stage.

						<p class="description">Considering that the game was being developed for a Nintendo Switch, I had to learn to make performant games.
							Every single object in this game except for power-up effects, either solid-color or textured, used the same material and an atlas sheet for textures.

						<p class="description">The game has never moved past the prototype stage as I was offered a place in developing the main title Shoppe Keep 2. I was mainly a programmer,
							responsible for ambience features, such as weather system, wildlife, water, also some standalone features, such as networked containers, custom area detection system,
							custom tools and etc.</p>
